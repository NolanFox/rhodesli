# ML Decision Provenance

All ML architectural decisions documented with full provenance in:
- `docs/ml/DATE_ESTIMATION_DECISIONS.md` — Date estimation pipeline
- `docs/ml/ALGORITHMIC_DECISIONS.md` — Canonical decision log (AD-NNN format)

When making ML decisions: document what was chosen, what was rejected and why, include cost analysis, include research sources with dates, update both domain doc AND ALGORITHMIC_DECISIONS.md.
