"""Heritage-specific image augmentations for date estimation training.

These augmentations simulate common artifacts in scanned heritage photos:
sepia toning, scanning artifacts, fading, and print texture.
"""

# Placeholder — will be implemented when date estimation model is active.
#
# Planned augmentations:
# - Sepia tone overlay (simulates aged prints)
# - Gaussian noise (simulates film grain)
# - Brightness/contrast jitter (simulates fading)
# - Random horizontal flip
# - Random crop with resize
# - Jpeg compression artifacts (simulates re-scanning)
#
# Uses torchvision.transforms v2 API.
