**Saved:** 2026-02-20
**Source:** User prompt at start of Session 54

## Summary
- Phase 0: Setup + Context Load
- Phase 1: Complete Session 53's Incomplete Fixes (640px resize, buffalo_sc, real upload tests)
- Phase 2: ML Architecture Decision (AD-110 hybrid architecture, AD-111-113)
- Phase 3: UX Issue Tracker (comprehensive, all dispositions)
- Phase 4: Quick Fixes (estimate indicator, 404 semantics, HTMX consistency)
- Phase 5: Harness Updates (ROADMAP, BACKLOG, UX audit files)
- Phase 6: Deploy + Verify

## Key Requirements
- Resize compare upload to 640px for ML path (display can stay larger)
- Investigate buffalo_sc embedding compatibility
- Test compare with real photos locally
- Document AD-110 Serving Path Contract invariant
- Create UX_ISSUE_TRACKER.md with every issue from audit files
- Fix estimate loading indicator, 404 semantics, HTMX indicators
- Update all harness docs

## Context Files
- docs/session_context/rhodesli-session-54-context.md (architecture research + UX prioritization)
- docs/session_context/session_54_log.md (session log, created during session)
