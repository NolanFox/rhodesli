## Strategic Insights (from Claude Benatar conversation, Feb 2026)

- Community adoption is the #1 challenge, not technology
- Most people with photos won't bother unless UX is compelling
- Institutional partnerships (museum, archives) = credibility + steady users
- Book-writing workflow = potential use case for photo collection
- Enhancement remains high-priority UX feature despite ML concerns
- The "wow moment" (Photo Context with face overlays) needs to be the first thing people see
